 se_dominion_ideas_1: "More Precise Funding"
 se_dominion_ideas_1_desc: "Funding from our overlord would previously be squandered and divided up without end all over the place with little actual precision in the funding efforts. Now that we are our own dominion, we can direct these funds to actual building projects and infrastructure efforts in a much more concise manner."
 se_dominion_ideas_2: "Fair Self Rule"
 se_dominion_ideas_2_desc: "With ruling on our own in the manner comes ideas of laws and legislation that diverge from our overlord. Though we may not think exactly as our overlord does, we can put into action laws and legislation that are more suited to the local populace since we know them on a greater level than, well, our overlord knows them."
 se_dominion_ideas_3: "Frontiers of the Dominion"
 se_dominion_ideas_3_desc: "The various parts of our land are untamed and uncultivated, meaning anything from wild animals to brigands can hide out in them. Naturally we should be prepared with stalwart and strong defensive structures that emulate the strength of our overlord. From outposts to castles to military encampments, we will be needing them all."
 se_dominion_ideas_4: "Overlord Court Ties"
 se_dominion_ideas_4_desc: "The court of our land is inherently tied to the court of our overlord. From officials inside of it to materials used in its construction, every single person of our dominion knows that ideas and information are shared regularly between the two places and as such, officials are exchanged regularly too."
 se_dominion_ideas_5: "Points of Trade"
 se_dominion_ideas_5_desc: "How do we make our profits? Through taxation and trade of course. Taxation is an issue already sorted out thoroughly, but trade is something we must always be guarded by our people. Keeping it safe and ensuring that all caravans get through our land without injury is of vital importance to our well-being and our sustainability as a dominion."
 se_dominion_ideas_6: "Joint Protection Efforts"
 se_dominion_ideas_6_desc: "The safety of our land and the land of our overlord are of the utmost importance, thus contributing to the cause of protecting it is vital. Our military maintenance sector must be steadily improved alongside our military training sector so as to be ready for when war breaks out on our border or on our overlord's border."
 se_dominion_ideas_7: "Ready at any Time"
 se_dominion_ideas_7_desc: "Above all else, we must be on watch and ready for when hardship calls upon our people and our land. The military and the navy need to be in the best shape possible so that they can repel threats, ferry supplies, and relay information to and from places. All of this will help keep our lands not only prosperous, but also functional for the likes of ourselves and our overlord when needed."
