It is our natural duty to bring the Normans under our wing."
 fra_brittany_title: "End Breton Independence"

 fra_accept_briton_culture_title: "Breton Culture"
 fra_accept_briton_culture_desc: "The Bretons are certainly an odd people - with their own language and culture. If we are to properly integrate them into France, they must be taught to be French - and if they cannot, there is no harm in allowing them to keep their ways."
 fra_brest_port_title: "Port in Brest"
 fra_brest_port_desc: "Sitting at the very edge of France on the west, Brest is the optimal place for any colonial expansion, or, more consistently, the easiest spot for ships to reach for commerce.

 fra_catalonia_title: "Invade Catalonia"
 fra_catalonia_desc: "The Catalonians cry for freedom from their overlords. They have been stepped upon and had the boots of their oppressors smothered in their faces. We are better than any Spanish king. With promises of autonomy and free will, The Catalonians would make great subjects of ours."
 fra_take_it_title: "Seize Catalonia"
 fra_take_it_desc: "Catalonia sits at an important trading spot in the Mediterranean. Having the city, and, furthermore, the coastline around it, would bring great wealth to France. No more will our Mediterranean trade be limtied to the small ports in southern France, but we will have a large city to direct all of our trading partners to."
 fra_kingdom_of_aragon_title: "Kingdom of Aragon"
 fra_kingdom_of_aragon_desc: "Aragon has been a pest for quite some time now. They have been stealing our trade, money that should be rightfully ours. Barcelona and furthermore Catalonia would be great takes, our military advisors say, but why not simply seize as much land as possible?"
 fra_castile_toledo_title: "Castilian Crown"
 fra_castile_toledo_desc: "The Castilians sit at the heart of Iberia, and control most of the land there - Land that is inhabited by none other than their Spanish subjects, which seems like land that is very attractive.

 fra_leon_title: "Leonese Frontier"

We shall take the chance before it is too late."
 fra_islands_title: "Islands of the Atlantic"
 fra_islands_desc: "The Atlantic is an open water, land that can be claimed by anyone. Anyone who wants to enforce their claim will have to show some resolve - and, if we wish for something such as territory in the open new world, we will surely have no problem proving that it is French."

 fra_uni_avignon_desc: "Founded under Pope Boniface VIII, the university attracted a great deal of foreigner influx, eager to enlighten themselves, leaving good coin in exchange.

 fra_mercantilism_title: "Strengthen our Mercantilism"
 fra_mercantilism_desc: "France must be able to sustain itself economically. This would bring incredible good for our country. In times of war, we will not question who will feed the men, as we will have our food constantly being produced at a rate of which we can sustain it. We will not have to worry about outside forces controlling our income. The benefits of Mercantilism are many."
 fra_economic_reforms_title: "Economic Reforms"
 fra_economic_reforms_desc: "The French Economy has, for a long time, been entirely reliant on the production of food and agriculture. With the world around us changing, perhaps shifting to something more modern - like industry or trade - would serve us well."
 fra_more_mercantilism_title: "Mercantilist Nation"
 fra_more_mercantilism_desc: "Just as Prussia exists as an army with a state rather than a state with an army, our country should consist of merchants with a state, not a state with merchants."
 fra_best_title: "Fire of the Revolution"
 fra_best_desc: "The Revolution has sparked. Thousands of them, they march in Paris. They yell angry words, they give firey speeches, they sing patriotic songs... Look at the lot of them. Rebellions against monarchs is nothing new to the European world, but this? This is an entirely new level of rebellion. This is a Revolution, and it has come to reshape France inside out. Only time can tell what this might bring."
 fra_austria_title: "March on Vienna"

 fra_berlin_title: "The Gates of Berlin"
 fra_berlin_desc: "Berlin, what is there to speak of it? Many German cities stand about the Holy Roman Empire, but there are very few that can rival Berlin. Such a showcase of German culture. Such an economic wonderland... It must be ours."

 fra_valois_united_desc: "At last, we shall see the house De Valois united with one land!"
 Fra_naval_dominance_title: "Dominance in the Channel"
 Fra_naval_dominance_desc: "The English Channel is the seat of the English trade. All of, if not the vast majority of, the power of our greatest rival comes from the English Channel. If we can exert our control over this trade node, then we can potentially cripple the English economy."
 Fra_European_dominance_title: "Naval Dominance"
 Fra_European_dominance_desc: "The only thing stopping us from crushing the English threat once and for all is the damned water. It is the last thing stopping us from beheading the English king, capturing London, and doing many other things... But in order to actually succeed in doing these things, we will need to beat the English at their own naval game."
 fra_conquer_ireland_title: "Conquer Ireland"
 fra_conquer_ireland_desc: "Ireland stands as an easy conquest. A bit of a power grab if anything, Ireland does not stand at much relevance on the world stage- but it would be better for us to get it than anyone else."
 fra_saint_germain_title: "Edict of Saint-Germain"
 fra_saint_germain_desc: "In order to stop a rebellion of the Hugenots in our country, our best plan of action would probably to simply allow them to worship in peace."
 fra_nantes_title: "Edict of Nantes"
 fra_nantes_desc: "Allowing the Protestants to worship in peace seems like it may not be enough- Perhaps full acceptance in law to their Catholic brethren is the best thing we can do for them."
 fra_balearic_islands_title: "Mediterranean Possessions"
 fra_balearic_islands_desc: "The Mediterranean seems rich with trade. There are many great places for us to set up trading posts and seize some of this wealth- some of those places would include the Balearic islands."
 fra_andalusia_title: "Conquer Andalucia"
 fra_andalusia_desc: "Andalusia is the heart of the Spanish colonial empire. Not Madrid, but Andalusia- it's the first place that all the Spanish goods go to. Building our own port for our colonial goods to come to is quite costly- why not just take someone else's?"

 fra_uni_aix_desc: "Education in Early Modern France was a luxury up until the late 15th century, once France stabilized and was well underway.

Later, it became a beacon of scientific progress after undergoing a major expansion under French hold."
 fra_uni_paris_title: "Université de Paris"
 fra_uni_paris_desc: "A university older than time itself. Its libraries filled with all manner of dusty and rare manuscripts.

 fra_morocco_title: "End of Morocco"
 fra_morocco_desc: "Morocco, the disastrous sultunate sitting in North Africa, has caused enough trouble for our Spanish neighbors.

 fra_mexico_title: "Cities of Gold"

 fra_manufactories_desc: "Would you look at that, across the Channel! Some sort of... smoggy buildings, with people running in and out of them constantly. Is that where all of England's goods come from? Hm, maybe we could do something of that sort..."
 fra_spain_title: "Spanish Treachery"
 fra_spain_desc: "The Spanish have been of great service to us, but they would be of greater service if they were our subject. As friends, they surely would not mind such a thing, right?"
 fra_moscow_title: "March into Moscow"
 fra_moscow_desc: "'My enemies are many, my equals are none. In the shade of olive trees, they said Italy could never be conquered. In the land of Pharaoes and kings, they said Egypt could never be humbled. In the realm of forest and snow, they said Russia could never be tamed. Now they say nothing, they fear me, like a force of nature, a dealer of thunder and death. I say, I am Napoleon. I am Emperor!'"
 Fra_hegemon_title: "Hegemony in Europe"

 fra_capture_calais_title: "Capture Calais"
 fra_capture_calais_desc: "Calais stands as the staple port of English goods to cross the Channel and into England. It's important for the English economy, and for the trade around Western Europe- which are two solid reasons why we should take ownership of it."
 fra_conquer_calais_title: "Save Calais"
 fra_conquer_calais_desc: "Calais, being such an incredible port, shall be ours- as it is rightfully French. The English have no business in this French land, just as they have no business in Normandy."

 fra_invade_the_isle_title: "Invade the Isle"
 fra_invade_the_isle_desc: "The English, our bitter rival, have been able to thrash us for far too long. They sit across the Channel, certain that they will never see a hostile Frenchman step on their soil ever again. It's time to give them a bit of a surprise."
 fra_conquer_england_title: "Crown of England"
 fra_conquer_england_desc: "'The English know nothing except England. Their world if everything, beyond the Channel, beyond the Dogger, beyond the Irish Sea, there is nothing. There is only England, and the English world is the only thing they know.' The words of a Venetian diplomat have given us quite a reason to step in and remind the English that there are other people in the outside world."
 fra_conquer_scotland_title: "Scottish Glen"
 fra_conquer_scotland_desc: "The Scottish have been a long time ally of ours. They are rather incapable on their own, seeing their primitive farming methods and inability to defend themselves for longer than a year at a time. If we were to ensure the defense and protection of Scotland as a French province, then surely, they could be much more capable people."
 fra_renaissance_ideas_title: "Renaissance Ideas"
 fra_renaissance_ideas_desc: "Prosperous people are more akin to spend time in scientific and academic pursuits.

 fra_modernized_bureaucracy_title: "Modernized Bureaucracy"
 fra_modernized_bureaucracy_desc: "New Administrative advances and reforms in the Bureaucratic sector have enabled us to greatly increase the efficiency of our various Government systems.

 fra_mousson_title: "Pont-à-Mousson"
 fra_mousson_desc: "Lorraine was always an important province during the Late Middle Ages.

 fra_algiers_title: "The Algiers Colony"

 fra_tunis_title: "End Tunisian Sultanate"
 fra_tunis_desc: "Tunis, the dastardly brother of Morocco, has been pirating the seas for a lifetime. The men in their pirate ships sail the Mediterranean, looking for people and treasure to plunder. We shall march down to their lands and free the Christian slaves, and take back our once stolen wealth!"
 fra_caribbean_title: "Colonize the Caribbean"
 fra_caribbean_desc: "The Caribbean has many things to offer, they always say. It is filled with riches and wonders that no man has ever seen before. These sayings are untrue, as the Caribbean merely holds islands, savages and sugar. Sugar seems like it can make some good money, though, which is exactly why we must take as much as possible for ourselves. Les Cayes seems like a great place to set up shop."
 fra_louisiana_title: "Foothold in Louisiana"
 fra_louisiana_desc: "Our nation is filled with riches from America. Louisiana is our next logical colonial expansion, since its filled with fur and natives willing to trade."
 fra_thirteen_title: "Columbia"
 fra_thirteen_desc: "Columbia is not much of a land, once observed by the explorers to have not much beyond beaches and jungles. Upon further exploration, we have learned that there is much Cocoa to offer from the land. Chocolate would not be too bad of an industry for us to profit from."
 fra_plata_title: "La Plata Plateau"
 fra_plata_desc: "La Plata is a land of great fields. The land is pleasantly warm, offering many crops to be grown for us. The land to the south is rather empty, but could serve us great as stepping stones for further exploration into the South."
 fra_vive_la_title: "La Révolution Française"
 fra_vive_la_desc: "From Feudalism to Empire. Such is our states history. Napoleon Bonaparte, a briliant leader, turning warfare to an art, was chosen by god himself to lead the greatest state in all of Europe. With him, even a European colination against us will lead into another French victory."
 fra_cairo_title: "Battle of the Pyramids"
 fra_cairo_desc: "Egypt. The cradle of civilization, where many have prevailed, and many have lost. Where our enemies will be defeated, and the French army will be once more victorious"
 fra_egypt_title: "Campaign in Egypt"
 fra_egypt_desc: "Egypt shall be our foothold into Anatolia, Africa as well as the Middle East. We must continue our efforts there, since defeat here means the humiliation of the French state."
 fra_curtail_title: "Curtail the Noble Power"
 fra_curtail_desc: "The Nobles of France have held too much power. In parts of France there are free men. In other parts, the Nobility still hold onto what land they have, and enforce Serfdom among their subjects. Serfdom is no longer efficient, and it's time for these men to get with the times."
 fra_estates_title: "Loyal Estates"
 fra_estates_desc: "As a ruler, there are several things you must control. People, money, trade, the military, you name it. But not only are you the one to control them, but you must also have others to help you. Making sure that others are willing to help you in your time of need is of great importance to ruling any nation."
 fra_crush_the_empire_title: "Crush the Empire"
 fra_crush_the_empire_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire has served it's purpose as a roadblock in foreign expansion into Germany. With laws so complicated, things so entangled, and the glooming possibility of the Habsburgs declaring themselves as the direct rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, Austria could become a major power in Europe, and no one would be able to stop them. We must stop this before it happens, and we will never see France again."
 fra_lorraine_title: "Lorraine"
 fra_lorraine_desc: "Lorraine is rightful French territory, despite many disputes by the German princes and kings within the Empire. It is of incredibly strategic importance that we seize the defenses on the Lorraine so that we may put them to use ourselves."
 fra_alsace_title: "Hills of Alsace"
 fra_alsace_desc: "Alscae, just like Lorraine, is rightful French territory. In truth, there are very few Frenchmen living in Alscae, but holding the land will be of just as much strategic importance as Lorraine - but with more economic power."
 fra_rhein_title: "Border on the Rhine"
 fra_rhein_desc: "The Rhine River serves as a natural border from us and the Germans. Crossig the Rhine, a river of great economic importance, would be a madman's work. Perhaps we should paint the map so that the borders are not only more natural looking, but easily defendable?"
 fra_swiss_title: "The Swiss Cantons"
 fra_swiss_desc: "The Swiss have maintained the right to be neutral for as long as we can remember. They refuse to join any conflict, and, by doing so, have asserted themselves as simply those who wish to be left alone. No nation can be forgotten in our empire, and the Swiss seem like easy pickings."
 fra_piedmont_title: "Push Into Italy"
 fra_piedmont_desc: "Italy is the most wealthy region in all of Europe. Filled with merchants, craftsmen, artists. All of these professionalities will help our court to reach its height."
 fra_lombardy_title: "Lombard Claims"

 fra_first_reforms_desc: "Back in Feudal France, most of the Bureaucratic power rested on local Tax Collectors, who had immense power upon the local folks. These Collectors enjoyed the protection and favor of various factions in our country and thus we need to reign them in."
 fra_modern_empire_title: "A Modern Empire"
 fra_modern_empire_desc: "Vast stretches of conquest in Europe, our elevation in our enemies' eyes and the back-to-back successes of our army have made us masters of expanding and integrating less cultured peoples in our glorious French Empire at remarkable speed and efficiency."
 fra_new_religion_title: "A New Religion"
 fra_new_religion_desc: "With Luther and the beginning of the Protestant movement, the Clergy were shaken to their core, all the way up to the Pope Himself. New religious hubris, talks of the Pope's fall from grace gather among the people of France. This is formally the beginning of the infamous "Wars of Religion" in France. Truly a dark time."
 fra_beyond_the_crisis_title: "Beyond the Crisis"
 fra_beyond_the_crisis_desc: "The dust has settled. Bodies lay naked on the streets, their loved ones never had the chance to give them a proper burial. The Religious Wars have taken a great toll on France. The fires and the screams that used to fill the nights of zealotism and raids has now gone quiet, nothing remains but smoldering ashes and frozen faces.We must carry our wounds and learn from them."
 fra_explore_title: "Delve into the Seas"
 fra_explore_desc: "Tales of a great land, a virgin, unexplored land that could be filled with wonder have reach the ears of everyone in France. Not everyone in Europe has heard of this, however, so we must be as quick as possible to claim as much of this land as possible. However, before you can claim land, you must first know that it exists."
 fra_foothold_title: "Foothold in Terra Nova"
 fra_foothold_desc: "In order to ensure that we have a point we can always fall back to in this new world, we must establish a solid landing ground for us to operate upon."

 fra_lawrence_title: "Gulf of St. Lawrence"
 fra_lawrence_desc: "The Gulf of St. Lawrence is just as important as the river of it's namesake. We must control the waters in which the river meets so that we may ensure that our merchant ships are safe and sound in our land."
 fra_brazil_title: "Bresil"
 fra_brazil_desc: "Bresil, a land of wealth, a land of sugar. Sugar is a great commodity to control, and it may just become important someday- you never know. Investing in sugar by colonising Bresil would not be half bad of an idea."
 fra_india_title: "Base in India"
 fra_india_desc: "Tales of lands not only west, but east as well, have reach the ears of our merchants and colonists. They wish to establish companies and control cities along the subcontinent, hoping for great wealth and fame. Allowing them to do so would not be half bad of an idea, because, backed by us, we are always sure to make a buck out if their ventures."
 fra_india_conquered_title: "Conquer India"
 fra_india_conquered_desc: "India stands at threat to being controlled by other powers. The wealth of the land cannot be risked at the hands of others, so, we must be quick to ensure the whole land is under French rule."
 fra_batavian_title: "The Batavian Republic"
 fra_batavian_desc: "The Low Countries are under ineffective rule under the Netherlands. They are effectively a puppet of the British, so naturally it's our duty to show them how a real leader rules."
 napoleon_italy_title: "The Kingdom of Italy"
 napoleon_italy_desc: "The first route of expansion is into Italy, a bunch of fighting duchies and republics. Uniting them under one French kingdom would do them a load of good."
 fra_confederation_title: "Confederation of the Rhine"
 fra_confederation_desc: "The Rhineland is our next door neighbor, and yet we have failed time and time again to capture it. Our new emperor however, is a military genius, and an ambitious one at that. Because of this, we can safely say that the Rhineland shall be ours."
 fra_warsaw_title: "Duchy of Warsaw"

 fra_burgundian_succession_title: "Burgundian Succession"
 fra_burgundian_succession_desc: "The Burgundians have had their lands promised to us, should their duke Charles die without an heir. They have been a thorn in our side for quite some time now- just powerful enough to pose a threat to us. We must ensure the death of Charles so that the threat that is Burgundy can be wiped off of this Earth!"
 fra_emperor_possessions_title: "Emperor's Possesions"
 fra_emperor_possessions_desc: "The Lands of any Emperor are to be respected. The lands of any Emperor are not to be challenged. The lands of any Emperor are not to be... Wait, what's the French army doing in the Emperor's lands?"
 fra_savoie_title: "Foothills of Alps"
 fra_savoie_desc: "The Alpine mountains are of great importance to our country. They are a roadblock, more than anything. Any prince of Italy owning them is a great trouble for our nation, as walking an army through mountains is an incredibly difficult task. Controlling them ourselves will make things much, much easier."
 fra_nice_title: "Conquer Nice"
 fra_nice_desc: "Nice sits at a good spot along the Mediterranean. It is right under the Alps, meaning that we will not have to walk through the mountains, should we need to invade Italy. Strategically, it would be unwise for us not to seize the city."
 fra_genoese_greed_title: "Genoese Greed"
 fra_genoese_greed_desc: "Genoa, the greedy lot. They have been hogging the trade in the Mediterranean since Venice began to decline. Venice is quite far from us, but Genoa is quite close. We should take it upon ourselves to put these greedy men in their place."
 fra_central_italy_title: "Italie Centrale"
 fra_central_italy_desc: "Central Italy offers more wealth than any man could imagine. It's cities are full of men, ripe for the recruiting. They also bear merchants, sailors, and other men important to our world. Perhaps it's time for them to learn who they would be better ruled by."
 fra_rome_title: "Roma"
 fra_rome_desc: "Rome would be an incredibly important possession to hold. Not only would we have a direct line of communication with the Pope, but we would show the whole Catholic- perhaps, Christian- world that we are one of the greatest nations on Earth."
 fra_Naples_title: "Neapolitan Succession"

 fra_centralization_title: "Centralization Effort"
 fra_centralization_desc: "As the case was with Tax Collectors before the Bureaucratic Reforms, so it was with local Nobles and Lords. The provinces under their jurisdiction were far too autonomous for any real power to be concentrated in the Monarch. Thus it's vital to lower their Autonomy and keep these Nobles in line."
 fra_centralized_army_title: "A Centralized Army"
 fra_centralized_army_desc: "Up to this point, the French army has mostly been consisting of unruly mercenaries and local lords who could rebel at any time. However, towards the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century, this began to change. Regular troops overtook the amount of mercenaries and the once-powerful lords were relegated to local duties only, leaving the French Army to be commanded by and serve, the King."
 fra_the_huguenots_title: "The Huguenots"
 fra_the_huguenots_desc: "Once a prominent minority that later grew in numbers, the Huguenots were considered at best vocal heretics by the local religious authorities.

 fra_ivory_title: "Côte d'Ivoire"
 fra_ivory_desc: "Step two is to set down the first stepping stone. The Ivory Coast would be a great place to hold onto, seeing how it is conveniently placed in Sub-Saharan Africa."
 fra_cape_title: "Cape Colony"
 fra_cape_desc: "Step three is to go a little bit farther. The Cape Colony sits at the very end of Africa, and it would be a better place than the Ivory Coast to resupply our ships. Perhaps colonising the area would not be a bad idea?"
 fra_malacca_title: "Malaccan Straits"
 fra_malacca_desc: "The Straits of Malacca are the last place that is visited by merchant ships before they head off to India, and, furthermore, Europe. The owner of these straits has one of the greatest advantages in the Spice Trade that could be imagined."
 fra_spice_trade_title: "The Spice Trade"
 fra_spice_trade_desc: "The Straits of Malacca are not enough, we must not only control the flow of spice, but produce our own. The world will remember the name of the French East India Company!"

Widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest fighting forces ever assembled, it suffered terrible losses during the French invasion of Russia in 1812 and never recovered its tactical superiority after that campaign."

 # Events:
 ME_France_Events.1.t: "The Question of Provence"
 ME_France_Events.1.d: "The Valois State of Provence has disconnected from our Crown in Paris. Existence of that state right on our border is a treason against us, what should we do with the state, now when we have broken our alliance with them?"
 ME_France_Events.1.a: "Claim their Throne!"
 ME_France_Events.1.b: "Claim their Duchy!"
 
 ME_France_Events.2.t: "The Empire has been Crushed!"
 ME_France_Events.2.d: "For a long time, the weak, petty little German duchies have stood no chance individually against our might, but are united as one, fighting against their imminent doom to our supremacy. We have dominated our role in this gathering storm, by damaging the legitimacy of the Empire!"
 ME_France_Events.2.a: "Magnifique."
 
 ME_France_Events.3.t: "Our Empire - Dissolved!"
 ME_France_Events.3.d: "The French have been an encroaching threat as they lay their hands on various lands in the west, and seek to undermine the authority of the Empire. Now they have been able to seriously damage us, and our legitimacy is at stake."
 ME_France_Events.3.a: "We can only hope for a good turn of events."
 
 ME_France_Events.4.t: "Kingdom of Italy"
 ME_France_Events.4.d: "After a long bloody struggle, Italy has been taken under our direct rule and now pledges alligiance to the Emperor. However, we can not keep this for long, as it is too powerful and would cause far too much trouble if, per se, a rebellion occured."
 ME_France_Events.4.a: "Convert Italy into a client state under our overlordship."
 ME_France_Events.4.b: "No need."
 
 ME_France_Events.5.t: "Confederation of the Rhine"
 ME_France_Events.5.d: "We have recently acquired possession of Germany, and cannot yet fully assimilate them into our vast, growing empire. We should likely turn them into a vassal, but retaining ownership can undermine a potential rebellion."
 ME_France_Events.5.a: "Form a client state."
 ME_France_Events.5.b: "Leave it as is."
 
 ME_France_Events.6.t: "Batavian Republic"
 ME_France_Events.6.d: "The Dutch have fell to our might and have been subsequently subjguated under our rule. As we have overextended our borders to take all this land, we can set up a puppet state that will rightfully keep the Dutch as our loyal vassals."
 ME_France_Events.6.a: "Create a client state to maintain the Dutch lands."
 ME_France_Events.6.d: "That will not be necessary."
 
 ME_France_Events.7.t: "Duchy of Warsaw"
 ME_France_Events.7.d: "After conquering our way into possessing Warsaw, we are now extremely far away from the [Root.GetName] homeland. Seeing this, we should likely set up another vassal state that can do our bidding from far away in Wasaw."
 ME_France_Events.7.a: "Make a Vassal State in Warsaw."
 ME_France_Events.7.b: "It may show our weakness in maintaining vast swathes of land."
 
 ME_France_Events.8.t: "Spanish Client Kingdom"
 ME_France_Events.8.d: "Although they onced helped us with our needs, the Spanish have proven to be useless and are most helpful under our rule, However, their lands are almost as large as our own and would likely not last under direct rule."
 ME_France_Events.8.a: "The Spanish Client State shall be formed.
 ME_France_Events.8.b: "Leave it be."
