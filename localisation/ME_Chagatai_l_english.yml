 # Missions:
 CHG_faithful_alignment_title: "Faithful Alignment"
 CHG_faithful_alignment_desc: "For nearly a century, the Khaganate has held Islam as its official faith, with each Khagan maintaining their spiritual duties. We cannot afford to let this aspect of our culture dissolve so easily, thus we must make an effort to preserve it."
 CHG_faithful_sacrilage_title: "Faithful Sacrilege"
 CHG_faithful_sacrilage_desc: "Though the Timurids follow our faith, they are a vile and evil nation bent on our destruction. Fortunately, they are absorbed in their own succession crisis, and thus we need not tread with caution. While they tear at each other, we shall deal the final blow."
 CHG_revive_the_ilkhanate_title: "Revive the Ilkhanate"
 CHG_revive_the_ilkhanate_desc: "The Ilkhanate met an untimely end from disease, war, and of course, other Mongols. Timur and the Golden Horde brought about their death, and we shall reverse that grave mistake."
 CHG_fragmented_khanate_title: "Fragmented Khanate"
 CHG_fragmented_khanate_desc: "What looms before us is not the grand Chagatai Khaganate. Rather, it is a splintered and disunified conglomerate of Mongol peoples, barely willing to work together against the impending threat of Timurid invasion. If we are to ensure the survival of the last of the four Khanates, we must swiftly solidify our state."
 CHG_yarkand_mongols_title: "Yarkent Mongols"
 CHG_yarkand_mongols_desc: "Our relation with the Yarkands is somewhat troubling. On the one hand, they are a dutiful ally and part of our domain, yet they are ethnically and culturally different, causing somewhat of a rift to appear. In addition, at the rate our nation is collapsing, it seems as though they will end up outliving us. We must enforce greater cohesion--one way or another."
 CHG_kazakh_mongols_title: "Kazakh Mongols"
 CHG_kazakh_mongols_desc: "The Kazakhs were an integral part of the Mongol Patrimony, yet they lay stateless, under foreign rule, and desecrated. We cannot allow these proud people to remain under servitude to adverse overlords."
 CHG_mongol_warfare_title: "Mongol Warfare"
 CHG_mongol_warfare_desc: "The Mongol Empire was once known for its legendary cavalry, galloping across the steppes as it razed villages and destroyed armies far more advanced than they. Despite inheriting these equine tactics, our army has fallen woefully behind in nearly every important field, including both technology and morale. We need a solution to this debacle before the neighboring tribes consume us completely."
 CHG_oirat_mongols_title: "Oirat Mongols"
 CHG_oirat_mongols_desc: "The Oirats have somehow managed to unite a massive confederation of Mongol tribes, including our homeland in Mongolia. Though our origin may be the same, they do not seem to share our inter-Mongol sentiments and seek conquest. We cannot succumb to any nation that might betray its former comrades."
 CHG_finish_the_federation_title: "Finish the Federation"
 CHG_finish_the_federation_desc: "The Oirat Federation was not prepared to finish this conflict, thus we must do what they could not. They shall feel the militant wrath of searing steal and arrows. Typically, we reserve the rape-and-pillage approach for stationary tribes or settlements, but we can make an exception in this scenario."
 CHG_trans_mongol_khanate_title: "Trans-Mongol Khaganate"
 CHG_trans_mongol_khanate_desc: "We now host many ethnicities and tribes of strictly Mongol people. We have reversed our misfortune and finally begun the restoration of the Grand Khaganate. We shall unite Mongols everywhere."
 CHG_nomadic_scramble_title: "Nomadic Scramble"
 CHG_nomadic_scramble_desc: "All the Chinese know of us are our might, and nomadic tendencies. Let us combine both and begin our push into China. We shall follow in the footsteps of the Great IKhan and bring all of China under Mongol rule."
 CHG_chinese_relations_title: "Chinese Relations"
 CHG_chinese_relations_desc: "Since the collapse of the Great Yuan, our relations with China have deteriorated significantly. Unlike the Yuan, the Ming Chinese see us as simply another pastoral tribe seeking their demise. We cannot simply submit, but compared to their power, we are but ants. Perhaps the peaceful route would spare us the same fate as the Yuan."
 CHG_the_splinters_title: "The Splinters"
 CHG_the_splinters_desc: "Since the collapse of the Great Yuan, our relations with China have deteriorated significantly. Unlike the Yuan, the Ming Chinese see us as simply another pastoral tribe seeking their demise. We cannot simply submit, but compared to their power, we are but ants. Perhaps the peaceful route would spare us the same fate as the Yuan."
 CHG_integrate_the_tribes_title: "Integrate the Tribes"
 CHG_integrate_the_tribes_desc: "The various Mongol tribes we have brought under our control remain disorganized and in need of centralized rule. Though we control them in name, they remain subject to their own desires. We must fix this grave oversight."
