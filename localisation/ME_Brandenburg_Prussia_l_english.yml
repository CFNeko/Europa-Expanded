 brandenburg_prussia_council_for_electorate_title: "Electorate's Privy Council"
 brandenburg_prussia_council_for_electorate_desc: "To reduce the influence of the estates, Joachim Frederick in 1604 created a council called 'Geheimer Rat für die Kurmark' ('Privy Council for the Electorate'), which instead of the estates was to function as the supreme advisory council for the elector. \nWhile the council was permanently established in 1613, it failed to gain any influence until 1651 due to the Thirty Years' War."
 brandenburg_prussia_excise_tax_title: "Excise Tax"
 brandenburg_prussia_excise_tax_desc: "Frederick William's excise tax (Akzise), which since 1667 replaced the property tax raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates."
 brandenburg_prussia_trade_port_of_berlin_title: "Trade Port of Berlin"
 brandenburg_prussia_trade_port_of_berlin_desc: "As we expand our realm, money becomes a real issue in keeping our army properly equipped. Securing the trade in our region will bring in more exotic goods as well as 'modernize' the [Root.GetAdjective] economy."

 brandenburg_prussia_absolutism_desc: "With the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] gaining power over the vast regions of its realm, the question of Absolutism has been growing in each person's mind. The rule of only one capable person."
 brandenburg_west_pomeranian_coast_title: "Conquer West Pomerania"
 brandenburg_west_pomeranian_coast_desc: "It is quite a privilege to be an elector of the Holy Roman Empire, but our quest for power is not only in politics. Our nation needs to reach the Pomeranian coastline in order to secure ports in the Baltic Sea."
 brandenburg_hanseatic_center_title: "The Hanseatic Center"
 brandenburg_hanseatic_center_desc: "The Hanseatic League shall be our main challenge in domination over the Baltic Sea. Their capital, fortunately, is located in [45.GetName], a city not too far away from our borders. It is time to raise the banners and finish this pathetic League once and for all!"
 prussia_supremacy_in_lower_saxony_title: "Supremacy in Lower Saxony"
 prussia_supremacy_in_lower_saxony_desc: "After showing the world of our accomplishments in the Silesian campaigns, many Northern German states have been more open to the idea of a united German state in Europe, whilst others have been more hostile towards us because of our aggressiveness. [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self was the one to be elected '[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Northern Germans', and that has made [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ambitions legitimate."
 prussia_king_of_the_north_title: "King of the North"
 prussia_king_of_the_north_desc: "Finally, Northern Germany has been, after centuries of bloodbath, united. The loyal and patriotic people of [Root.GetName] are ready to show the world its pride, culture, and history, even if some blood has to be spilled."
 brandenburg_reclaim_neumark_ME_title: "Reclaim Neumark"

 brandenburg_mecklenburgian_menace_desc: "Mecklenburg stands on our border with pride, ready to keep their state protected and prospering. [Root.GetName] says otherwise, thinking that its people need to submit to [Root.GetName]."

 brandenburg_preussen_gloria_desc: "The people of [Root.GetName] are no longer the underdog. We now control what is needed to proclaim ourselves as the mighty @PRU §YKingdom of Prussia§!. Our armies shall defeat the rest of the European ones, and the world shall know of our famed quality!"
 prussia_the_prussian_giant_title: "The Prussian Giant"
 prussia_the_prussian_giant_desc: "The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been divided for a long time. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the one to unite them as 'König von Preußen'. Now, the people look into their neighbors."
 prussia_conquer_silesia_ME_title: "Conquer Silesia"
 prussia_conquer_silesia_ME_desc: "Although some would say that our claim to Silesia is a bit shaky, we do have some grounds for claiming this province as our own. The prestige of our country depends on us pushing those claims."
 prussia_annex_lorraine_title: "Annex Lorraine"
 prussia_annex_lorraine_desc: "Lorraine is called by the cowardly French a de jure part of their realm. Their population, however, consists of mainly Germans, wishing that we liberate them."

 brandenburg_partition_of_poland_title: "Partition of Poland"
 brandenburg_partition_of_poland_desc: "Poland is weak and Russia wishes to continue to dominate her, for us to accept this situation we must be compensated with Polish lands."
 prussia_conquer_the_southern_states_title: "The Southern States"
 prussia_conquer_the_southern_states_desc: "We may have the charisma to unite the people of Northern Germany, but the conservative and backwards Southern states have yet to acknowledge our legitimacy, even after our victories. It is time to bring the sword to them in order to show who truly rules them."
 prussia_unite_the_south_title: "Unite the South"
 prussia_unite_the_south_desc: "Our victories in Saxony have proven quite effective in our efforts of unifying @GER §Y[GER.GetName]§!.

 brandenburg_prussia_general_war_commissariat_title: "General War Commissariat"
 brandenburg_prussia_general_war_commissariat_desc: "Following the defeats Prussia suffered in the 30 Years' War, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, set up the 'General War Commissariat' to oversee the army, as well as to levy taxes necessary to support the army. It soon became a bureaucratic machine for civil government as well. \nFrederick William used it to govern the state. Many members were landed aristocracy known as Junkers, who served in the army as well. The commissariats helped to centralize power."
 brandenburg_prussia_professionalism_title: "Prussian Professionalism"
 brandenburg_prussia_professionalism_desc: "Prussia was one of the many states in Europe to rely on a national and professional army. Whilst its population was small compared to other great powers, the administration and the training of it was what made it strong. In fact, in the battle of Hohenfriedburg, with each volley the Austrians fired, the Prussians fired 6 back."
 brandenburg_prussia_great_electors_army_title: "The Great Elector's Army"
 brandenburg_prussia_great_electors_army_desc: "Frederick William was a military commander of wide renown, and his standing army would later become the model for the Prussian Army. He is notable for his joint victory with Swedish forces at the Battle of Warsaw, which, according to Hajo Holborn, marked 'the beginning of Prussian military history', but the Swedes turned on him at the behest of King Louis XIV and invaded Brandenburg. \nAfter marching 250 kilometres in 15 days back to Brandenburg, he caught the Swedes by surprise and managed to defeat them on the field at the Battle of Fehrbellin, destroying the myth of Swedish military invincibility. \nHe later destroyed another Swedish army that invaded the Duchy of Prussia during the Great Sleigh Drive in 1678. \nHe is noted for his use of broad directives and delegation of decision-making to his commanders, which would later become the basis for the German doctrine of Auftragstaktik, and he is noted for using rapid mobility to defeat his foes."
 brandenburg_prussia_tactics_of_frederick_the_great_title: "Frederick the Great's Tactics"
 brandenburg_prussia_tactics_of_frederick_the_great_desc: "Contrary to what his father had feared, Frederick proved himself very courageous in battle (with the exception of his first battlefield experience, Mollwitz). He frequently led his military forces personally and had six horses shot from under him during battle. During his reign, he commanded the Prussian Army at sixteen major battles (most of which were victories for him) and various sieges, skirmishes, and other actions. He is often admired as one of the greatest tactical geniuses of all time, especially for his usage of the oblique order of battle, in which attack is focused on one flank of the opposing line, allowing a local advantage even if his forces were outnumbered overall (which they often were). Even more important were his operational successes, especially preventing the unification of numerically superior opposing armies and being at the right place at the right time to keep enemy armies out of Prussian core territory. \n\nAn example of the place that Frederick holds in history as a ruler is seen in Napoleon Bonaparte, who saw the Prussian king as the greatest tactical genius of all time; after Napoleon's victory of the Fourth Coalition in 1807, he visited Frederick's tomb in Potsdam and remarked to his officers, 'Gentlemen, if this man were still alive I would not be here'. Napoleon frequently 'pored through Frederick's campaign narratives and had a statuette of him placed in his personal cabinet.' Frederick and Napoleon are perhaps the most admiringly quoted military leaders in Clausewitz'On War. More than Frederick's use of the oblique order, Clausewitz praised particularly the quick and skillful movement of his troops. \n\nFrederick the Great's most notable and decisive military victories on the battlefield were the Battles of Hohenfriedberg, fought during the War of Austrian Succession in June 1745; the Battle of Rossbach, where Frederick defeated a combined Franco-Austrian army of 41,000 with a mere 21,000 soldiers (10,000 dead for the Franco-Austrian side with only 550 casualties for Prussia);and the Battle of Leuthen, which was a follow up victory to Rossbach pitting Frederick's 36,000 troops against Charles of Lorraine's Austrian force of 80,000—Frederick's masterful strategy and tactics at Leuthen inflicted 7,000 casualties upon the Austrians and yielded 20,000 prisoners."
