 # Startingscreen:
 string_start_title_bohemia: "The Interregnum In Bohemia"
 string_start_bohemia: "With the young  §YLadislaus the Posthumous§! being only 5 years old and the small civil wars in the realm, Bohemia is in a dangerous situation. \n\n\nThe Habsurgs in Austria think of you as a mere puppet, and will claim your throne when the time comes. Furthermore, Hungary seeks to claim your land as well, with §YJanos Hunyadi§! appointed regent of Hungary in the diet of Pest.\n\n\n Everything is not lost though, The hussites may be your greatest ally. Their will to fight hasn't changed since the hussite wars of 1419–1436. Their tactic of using wagons has proved to be effective, as well as their muskets and crossbows. Great leaders were born thanks to it. The Catholic world may not approve of it, but it has been proven that there is no way to defeat a follower of §YJan Hus§! in battle.\n\n\n Bohemia is a slavic nation, so its ambitions are to unite the slavic world under a greater nation. Poland will be your first and most logical target, since they have a big border with you. After defeating those traitors, ruthenia is the next to follow. And then, Russia itself. For a nation our size this may be hard to do, but courage and great leadership will make short work of any obstacle.\n\n\n Another path for your realm is retaking the Imperial Throne. Not long ago the Bohemians were ruling as superiors in the Empire. Time has passed by, and rules have changed though."

However, times have changed. Newfound spirit between the Bohemian people and a capable leadership has led their armies to great victories. Given the fact that the locals in Sachsen have long asked to be reunited with their Bohemian masters, we need to consider our actions and the worth of maintaining our alliance with our Eastern neighbor."
