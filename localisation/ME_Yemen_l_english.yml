 yemen_reincorporate_aden_title: "Reincorporate Aden"
 yemen_reincorporate_aden_desc: "The city of Aden has long since been Yemeni territory. As of late, they seem to be forgetting that we hold absolute authority over their nation. We must not let our hold in the city slip and should remind them of their subjugation by any means necessary. The city itself is imperative to our Gulf trade and thus retribution cannot be evoked upon it, but we need not be so kind to the surrounding Shiites."
 yemen_subjugate_rassids_title: "Subjugate the Rassids"
 yemen_subjugate_rassids_desc: "The heretical Rassids have fallen from grace and forgotten their place as servants of the Yemeni Sultan. Their nation is currently divided, we must make haste to take advantage of the situation and restore order to the countryside as well as shoring up our own Northern flank, though others may make pitiful attempts to do the same."
 yemen_the_giant_of_slaves_title: "The Giant of Slaves"
 yemen_the_giant_of_slaves_desc: "The Mamluk Sultanate has long since been a rival of ours, infringing upon our trade in the Red Sea and influencing both of the two Holy Cities, which are Arabian by right. Their recent struggle against the Turks may have left us an opening to strike and free their Arabian subjects from their foreign influence."
 yemen_the_sacred_cities_title: "The Sacred Cities"
 yemen_the_sacred_cities_desc: "Our two holiest cities: [385.GetName] and [384.GetName], the Seal's home and exile refuge, are in constant danger of Egyptian takeover. Our initial defense of the cities was a good start, but we knowingly took the mantle of the Defender of Arabia, and the [MAM.GetAdjective] [MAM.Monarch.GetTitle] has no place here. Our first step in their expulsion needs to be the incorporation of the Two Cities into our growing empire, where they will be most safe."
 yemen_scimitar_of_the_south_title: "Scimitar of the South"
 yemen_scimitar_of_the_south_desc: "The time has finally come to end Egyptian rule over the valuable lands they selfishly hold as their own. We must deliver a swift strike, followed by another, until we finally manage to land the final blow, the deadly slice to their throat. If we confiscate their most valuable lands and fortifications, they will be unable to recover between each peck at their premature cadaver. Time is of the essence; the vultures are already circling."
 yemen_reign_in_the_sharifs_title: "Reign in the Sharifs"
 yemen_reign_in_the_sharifs_desc: "The local power-holders in surrounding lands are either overwhelmingly Shia or overwhelmingly Sunni. Either way, it would be within our best interests to limit the expansion of our neighbors by annexing them completely and without mercy. This will have the unfortunate consequence of less competition in Gulf trade, but some sacrifices must be made for the prosperity of [Root.GetName]."
 yemen_bedouin_menace_title: "Bedouin Menace"
 yemen_bedouin_menace_desc: "The Bedouin Nomads have changed, and not for the better. Originally the true Meccans, the tribe has fallen from their originally prestigious throne to an impoverished state. Surely it would be a mercy to save the Bedouins from themselves."
 yemen_break_the_bedouins_title: "Break the Bedouins"
 yemen_break_the_bedouins_desc: "The various Bedouin tribes had their chance, now it's our turn. If our grand empire is to be realized, we must first clear the pastoral barriers that plague Central Arabia. Let us swiftly bring them under our control."
 yemen_sight_of_the_pond_title: "Sight of the Pond"
 yemen_sight_of_the_pond_desc: "Our recent expansionist policy has put us in the ideal situation to expand into regions surrounding the Persian Gulf, which in turn will allow us additional trade opportunities and depriving the Egyptians of one of their vital sources of income, as well as increasing our potential for naval warfare going forward."
 yemen_mesopotamian_liberation_title: "Mesopotamian Liberation"
 yemen_mesopotamian_liberation_desc: "Our mantle of the new Islamic Empire demands that we liberate [410.GetName], our former capital, from the violent Shiites that oppress the native Sunni majority. We would be doing a great service to the Iraqis by invading, therefore we should, no must, rally the troops at once. The [TUR.GetName] have been showing interest into this region, so we must make with haste."
 yemen_mochan_coffee_title: "Mochan Coffee"
 yemen_mochan_coffee_desc: "Our trade competitors may have gold, silver, or other precious resources to offer, but we are above that petty squabbling. We set the price of our staple good, for our coffee is unrivaled in flavor and quality. We must hold on to this advantage for as long as possible."
 yemen_yemeni_monopoly_title: "Yemeni Monopoly"
 yemen_yemeni_monopoly_desc: "We have done well to preserve our coffee secret for this long, though foreign coffee is gaining popularity. We cannot afford to lower our prices to compete, therefore we must strike at our enemies to save our product."
 yemen_secure_the_straits_title: "Secure the Straits"
 yemen_secure_the_straits_desc: "The primitive Africans inhabiting Eritrea cannot be counted on to allow us access to the Horn of Africa, a region vital to protect our trade. We must take the only crossing point and we must be able to defend it from the Adali and Ethiopians who content our claim."
 yemen_the_adal_question_title: "The Adal Question"
 yemen_the_adal_question_desc: "The war between the [ADA.GetAdjective] and [ETH.GetAdjective] empires has been long and bloody. Both have been weakened by the struggle, giving us a great opportunity to strike. Currently, [ADA.GetName] holds land vital to our trade, though another invasion would be costly, especially since we aim to annex such a large portion of their nation. If we could convince them to pledge their undying loyalty to us, we could deescalate the situation without the need for war."
 yemen_the_rhinos_horn_title: "The Rhino's Horn"
 yemen_the_rhinos_horn_desc: "The religious melting pot of Ethiopia would not be beneficial to bring under our sphere of influence. The area is too divided and separatist sentiments would quickly overpower us. However, the Horn of Africa is soothingly Sunni, and would supplement our trade in the Indian Ocean very well and provide a decent manpower pool for our next operation."
 yemen_fiend_of_the_north_title: "Fiend of the North"
 yemen_fiend_of_the_north_desc: "The [MAM.GetName] really have no business in Africa South of the Egyptian Desert, no matter what they think. It is within both our and the world's best interests to end their reign bordering the Red Sea forever, and Southern Egypt would make for the best point to launch an attack into [361.GetName]."
 yemen_adenistic_dominance_title: "Adenistic Dominance"
 yemen_adenistic_dominance_desc: "In Aden's Gulf lies one of the few areas in the world Indian goods accumulate in close enough proximity to Europe to quickly sell them off to the desperate Christians. The Egyptians surely wouldn't pass up such a profitable opportunity to pass these goods on to the Mediterranean."
 yemen_dastardly_shariha_title: "Dastardly Shariha"
 yemen_dastardly_shariha_desc: "The evil [MAM.GetName] have prevented our goods from reaching Europe, save for a few unreliable smugglers that are still loyal. Perhaps they require some more concrete persuasion for our negotiations to be successful."
 yemen_silent_jihad_title: "Silent Jihad"
 yemen_silent_jihad_desc: "The enemies of Islam in India have seen our prosperity and look on with disgust. It is our duty to Allah to keep these mercantile devils from rising to power through utterly dominating their merchants through our superior products and wisdom."
 yemen_lanka_doctrine_title: "Lanka Doctrine"
 yemen_lanka_doctrine_desc: "The island of Lanka is strategically vital to our Indian Ocean due to its location near the alhndws and its potential as a base for future Indian Ocean expansion. If we are to dominate the entirety of the Indian Ocean trade, Lanka is the best base to push off of. Alternatively, we could invade the Maldives, though it's doubtful whether that would convey the same message to our opponents."
 yemen_shia_debacle_title: "Shia Debacle"
 yemen_shia_debacle_desc: "The divide over who should fulfill the position of Sultan has been a long and bloody one. Before more lives are lost, we must choose whether to embrace the Shia majority in [4280.GetName] or force them to see the wisdom in adopting Sunni as their own."
 yemen_ibadi_encounter_title: "Ibadi Encounter"
 yemen_ibadi_encounter_desc: "A new, albeit less common, heretical group was conquered: Ibadi. We need to decide how to handle this group. We can't justify the normal methods we employ on the Shiites, for the Shiites struck first, many centuries ago. The Ibadi seem to be a relatively small movement, claiming to have preceded our Sunni denomination. This is ridiculous, and frankly an insult. We can use their grave misstep as a pretext for deportation or conversion, or we can attempt to coexist."
 yemen_africa_doctrine_title: "Africa Doctrine"
 yemen_africa_doctrine_desc: "The Europeans seem to have taken to a doctrine of colonization and expansion in other continents. All of our encounters with the Portuguese have been met with hostility at best, cannon-fire at worst. We cannot let them reach the Indian Ocean, lest we perish alongside the Africans. Occupying the desolate Southern tip of Africa, as well as a few neighboring islands, should discourage the Europeans from advancing."
 yemen_wealth_doctrine_title: "Wealth Doctrine"
 yemen_wealth_doctrine_desc: "We have just received word that just east of our Comoros holdings lies a land of unimaginable paradoxical characteristics known as the Island of Rukh. A Venetian merchant reportedly saw a bird with a wingspan equal to the length of a dozen elephants. We must ensure we are the first civilized occupier of this Island."
 
 YEM_TOLERANCE_OF_IBADI_IS_AT_LEAST_2: "Tolerance of the §YIbadi§! faith is at least §Y2§!"

 # Events:
 ME_Yemen_Events.EVTNAME1: "Bedouin Support"
 ME_Yemen_Events.EVTDESC1: "Alongside our recent successes in [385.GetName] and [384.GetName], the various Bedouin nations of Arabia have begun to take notice of our power. The notion of servitude seems to come easy to them, and whether out of fear or will, we could send an envoy to each tribe, offering our protection in exchange for their loyalty."
 ME_Yemen_Events1.EVTOPT1: "They could serve as our subjects."
 ME_Yemen_Events1.EVTOPT2: "Their support, while appreciated, would be better spent elsewhere."
 ME_Yemen_Events1.EVTOPT3: "We will have to decline. We cannot be seen collaborating with savages."
 
 ME_Yemen_Events.EVTNAME2: "[From.GetName] offers march status"
 ME_Yemen_Events.EVTDESC2: "[From.GetName] has offered us to become their march. This will make us a [From.GetAdjective] subject, but more importantly it will make them protect us. \n\nShould be accept this offer?"
 ME_Yemen_Events2.EVTOPT1: "Accept this offer."
 ME_Yemen_Events2.EVTOPT2: "Never!"
 
 ME_Yemen_Events.EVTNAME3: "Elephant Bird"
 ME_Yemen_Events.EVTDESC3: "After a long expedition in Rukh, a massive bird was found, dubbed the "Elephant Bird". None others could be found in its vicinity. It showed signs of distress and walked with an extreme limp. The captain of the expedition saw fit to put the bird out of its misery. They found a single egg in its nest, which they proceeded to cook and eat."
 ME_Yemen_Events3.EVTOPT1: "Interesting"
 
 YEM_COUNTRY_MAY_BECOME_OUR_MARCH: "@[This.GetTag] §Y[This.GetName]§! is offered to become our §YMarch§!. \nIf they §Rdecline§!, we will receive a '§YSubjugation§!' Casus Belli on them.\n"
