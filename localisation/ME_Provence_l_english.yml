 #Provence Stuff
 
 PRO_churches_title: "Restore the Churches" 
 PRO_churches_desc: "The 12th century saw a great deal of new churches and cathederals in the Provence Proper. These buildings were made in a style mimicking the glory of Roman archiecture; nowadays they have grown old and no longer shine as they once did. With the resurgence of ancient knowledge, now is a perfect time to reinvigorate them."
 
 PRO_france_friend_title: "Strengthen Ties with [FRA.Monarch.GetName]"
 PRO_france_friend_desc: "Even since the days of the Carolingians, the Counts of Provence were in very close proximity to France, both policitally and geographically. In 1237, Count of Provence, Ramon Berenguer IV, married his daughter off to King Louis IX of France. In these precarious days, it would do us well to cement this relationship with France and the Angevin Dynasty."
 pro_not_hre.tooltip: "Has NOT completed mission §YMend Ties with the Holy Roman Empire§!"
 
 PRO_hre_friend_title: "Mend Ties with the Holy Roman Empire"
 PRO_hre_friend_desc: "Perhaps persuing a close relationship with France in the past and severing our status as a fiefdom of the Holy Roman Empire was a bit rash. But the times have changed since that decision two hundred years ago, and seeking protection by the Emperor may be better for our own intrests."
 pro_not_fra.tooltip: "Has NOT completed mission §YStrengthen Ties with [FRA.Monarch.GetName]§!"
 
 PRO_avignon_title: "Reclaim Avignon"
 PRO_avignon_desc: "Avignon has long been part of the Provençal realm. In 1309 it was given to the Papacy to act as the reigning capital. During that time, it saw the reign of seven popes and three antipopes. The seat of the Papacy, however has returned to Rome; unfortunately the Papacy seems a bit to hesitant to return our rightful lands..."
 
 PRO_lorraine_title: "Ameliorate Lorraine"
 PRO_lorraine_desc: "The Duchy of Lorraine is among the many titles the Good King has accumulated. Though they are not yet fully integrated into our realm, it is never too late to improve relations with our future domains."
 
 PRO_annex_lorraine_title: "Integrate Lorraine"
 PRO_annex_lorraine_desc: "The time has come to make our realms one!"
 
 PRO_holyland_title: "The King of Jerusalem"
 PRO_holyland_desc: "Though many have claimed the title 'King of Jerusalem,' few have been able to actually press that claim. Will the claims of the Good King pass into the annals of history, or will we make history itself?"
 
 PRO_naples_title: "The King of Naples"
 PRO_naples_desc: "Though his brother was recognized King of Naples, René of Anjou ascended to the throne when the brother died before succeeding the claim. The title was quickly snatched from us by the King of Aragon - however it is never too late to take it back."
 
 PRO_aragon_title: "The King of Aragon"
 PRO_aragon_desc: "The claims of René of Anjou passed mostly into obscurity in the midst of the Catalan Civil War. The justification does exist though..."

 PRO_france_claim_title: "The King of France"
 PRO_france_claim_desc: "Our ties with the King of France have become increasingly harder to undo. It is only a matter of time before we can press an advantadge in the French court by way of exploiting a weak king."
 pro_french_friends.toolip: "Completed mission §YStrengthen Ties with [FRA.Monarch.GetName]§! at least §Y25§! years ago"
 
 PRO_crusade_title: "Establish the Holy Land"
 PRO_crusade_desc: "The religious fervor has set the realm ablaze and now a desire to establish the Kingdom of Jerusalem has arisen. Deus Vult!"
 
 PRO_hre_elector_title: "Provençal Electorate"
 PRO_hre_elector_desc: "Our relations with the emperor due to careful diplomatic manuvering has given us the oppurtunity to join the esteemed ranks of the other electors."
