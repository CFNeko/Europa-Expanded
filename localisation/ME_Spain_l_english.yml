 ME_Spain_Events.EVTNAME3: "Unification of the Habsburgs"
 ME_Spain_Events.EVTDESC3: "The [From.GetAdjective] branch of the Habsburg dynasty claims to be the most powerful one. They say they need to save the Austrian lands from pretender rebels. \nThey see no other way than uniting both empires under their ruler and because we are family, they send a diplomatic request. However, they will probably try to get their will by force, if we don't accept now."
 ME_Spain_Events3.EVTOPT1: "Form the Habsburg Union."

 ME_Spain_Events.EVTNAME9: "Administration of the Holy Land"
 ME_Spain_Events.EVTDESC9: "After so many years under Muslim supression, we finally got control over Jerusalem. Now we have the choice between keeping the land under Spanish rule, which would be the best way to protect it, but what will be viewed negatively by the Catholic world.

 ME_Spain_Events.EVTNAME10: "El Escorial"
 ME_Spain_Events.EVTDESC10: "The Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, commonly known as Monasterio del Escorial, is a historical residence of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Spain, in the town of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, about 45 kilometres northwest of the capital, §Y[217.GetCapitalName]§!, in Spain. It is one of the Spanish royal sites and has functioned as a monastery, basilica, royal palace, pantheon, library, museum, university, school and hospital. \nEl Escorial comprises two architectural complexes of great historical and cultural significance: the royal monastery itself and La Granjilla de La Fresneda, a royal hunting lodge and monastic retreat about five kilometres away. These sites have a dual nature: That is to say, during the 16th and 17th centuries, they were places in which the power of the Spanish monarchy and the ecclesiastical predominance of the Roman Catholic religion in Spain found a common architectural manifestation. \nEl Escorial was, at once, a monastery and a Spanish royal palace. \n\nPhilip II of Spain, reacting to the changes of the 16th century, dedicated much of his lengthy reign (1556–1598) and much of his seemingly inexhaustible supply of New World gold to stemming the tide. His protracted efforts were, in the long run, partly successful. However, the same impulse had a much more benign expression thirty years earlier in Philip's decision to build the complex at El Escorial. \nPhilip engaged the Spanish architect, Juan Bautista de Toledo, to be his collaborator in the design of El Escorial. Juan Bautista had spent the greater part of his career in Rome, where he had worked on the basilica of St. Peter's, and in Naples, where he had served the king's viceroy, whose recommendation brought him to the king's attention. Philip appointed him architect-royal in 1559, and together they designed El Escorial as a monument to Spain's role as a center of the Christian world."
 ME_Spain_Events10.EVTOPT1: "Wonderful."
 
 SPA_MLO_WILL_NOT_COST_A_DIPLO_SLOT: "Our rule over @MLO §Y[MLO.GetName]§! will not take a diplomatic relations slot."

 SPA_HAB_UNION_WILL_ALWAYS_BREAK_ON_MONARCH_DEATH: "\n\n§YThe union with [HAB.GetName] will break after the death of the ruler, under which reign the union was established. Although we will always be able to restore it by war, this applies to all unions with [HAB.GetName].§!"
