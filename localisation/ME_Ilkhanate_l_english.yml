 # Missions:
 ilkhanate_shaky_allegiance_title: "Shaky Allegiance"
 ilkhanate_shaky_allegiance_desc: "Before us stands a monumental restoration of perhaps the most tragic imperial decline in history. The land so many Mongols fought and bled for reduced to depravity in mere decades. The Ilkhanate is ours and we'll see our history wiped clean by fully restoring our former glory."
 ilkhanate_persian_reclamation_title: "Persian Reclamation"
 ilkhanate_persian_reclamation_desc: "As the years passed by, so did our legacy. We assumed we would be remembered for our benevolent rule and iron fist, yet the annals of history have swept us away like a feather in the wind. And like said feather, we returned upon the wind's change. Shall we commence our reclamation?"
 ilkhanate_persian_legacy_title: "Persian Legacy"
 ilkhanate_persian_legacy_desc: "The legacy of Persia lies not in its culture, but in its conquests. From Anatolia to Khorasan, they raised their flags high, seemingly unstoppable - until us, of course. The time has come to usurp this legacy. In the past, we were at odds with combining our Persian identity with our Mongol lifestyle, but now we know that we are all simply humans in the omniscient eyes of Allah. There is no reason for inward conflict, as it simply interferes with our outward Jihad."
 ilkhanate_squabbling_sinners_title: "Squabbling Sinners"
 ilkhanate_squabbling_sinners_desc: "Throughout India lies numerous petty nations that proclaim themselves Islamic with no backing other than a stiff spine of the sultan. In most cases, an Islamic head benefits the body, but in this case, the people remain in a religious minority, as dictated by the state. It is our righteous and holy duty to correct their grave insubordination by confiscating their land and bringing true Islam to their people."
 ilkhanate_crush_india_movement_title: "Crush India Movement"
 ilkhanate_crush_india_movement_desc: "India is comprised of numerous failed Islamic states that are an embarrassment to our faith. We cannot allow this disgrace to stand. Our conquests into India are currently minuscule... let us fix that."
 ilkhanate_indian_momentum_title: "Indian Momentum"
 ilkhanate_indian_momentum_desc: "Our conquests in India have brought us great wealth and status among our military rivals. Should we continue this grand momentum, we may be able to consolidate all of India under our rule."
 ilkhanate_finish_the_elephant_title: "Finish the Elephant"
 ilkhanate_finish_the_elephant_desc: "Now that India is all but finished, we need but deal the final blow. Such a strike must be swift and painless to preserve the people we have fought to hard to bring under our protection."
 ilkhanate_horde_unity_title: "Horde Unity"
 ilkhanate_horde_unity_desc: "Though our roots lie in the Mongol Empire, we cannot hope to replicate what they built with a people diverged from their ancestry. At least, not yet. Alas, one truth remains clear: the horde remains far more important than anything else. We must ensure the horde survives this dynamic shift in power through careful delegation."
 ilkhanate_turkic_pests_title: "Turkic Pests"
 ilkhanate_turkic_pests_desc: "Anatolia did not halt our conquests previously, and it shall not halt us now. Although compared to Europe they are mighty, compared to us the Turks are nothing but a nuisance. Our empires shall clash, and we shall emerge victorious."
 ilkhanate_mountain_of_oppresion_title: "Mountain of Oppression"
 ilkhanate_mountain_of_oppresion_desc: "The border territory of Kashmir may be particularly worthless to us, but to the people living there, it is their whole world. Unfortunately, they have chosen the path of resistance, and have sided with their heretic lords against us. This cannot stand, as it is a grave insult to our power."
 ilkhanate_mountain_men_title: "Mountain Men"
 ilkhanate_mountain_men_desc: "The men of Tibet prefer peace over violence, virtue over sin. A respectable cause, but ultimately unwise in the wake of coming aggression. We need to save these men before more malicious entities take root and begin their unjust conquests."
 ilkhanate_a_mile_marking_stone_title: "Mile-Marking Stone"
 ilkhanate_a_mile_marking_stone_desc: "With our conquest of Tibet taken care of, all that remains is the land of China until we might reconquer our homeland of Mongolia. Beginning our campaign in the peaceful Southwestern portion of the nation should suffice."
 ilkhanate_burma_campaign_title: "Burma Campaign"
 ilkhanate_burma_campaign_desc: "The rich land of Burma will merge our two-pronged strike at China, allowing for quick troop movement between the two massive stretches of land. Therefore, it is of strategic vitality and must be conquered at once."
 ilkhanate_yuan_campaign_title: "Yuan Campaign"
 ilkhanate_yuan_campaign_desc: "The Yuan Dynasty was violently usurped without cause. The xenophobic, pitiful Han Chinese decided to restore their own incompetent government. We cannot let this insult stand without recompense. We shall ensure their downfall is slow and painful."
 ilkhanate_the_white_horse_title: "The White Horse"
 ilkhanate_the_white_horse_desc: "The gospel of John speaks of a White Horse whose goal of conquest gave way to a festering pestilence. We see now that this apocalyptic calamity, portrayed by John, foretold of our great demise at the hand of the plague. Just as conquest gave way to pestilence, pestilence shall give way to conquest. Let us usurp this Biblical conclusion by riding our own White Horse into battle."
 ilkhanate_an_aged_vendetta_title: "An Aged Vendetta"
 ilkhanate_an_aged_vendetta_desc: "The filthy, slavelike [MAM.GetName], through deceit and treachery, managed to defeat us in battle. It remains the only battle we have not repaid in kind, for we were then forced to withdraw at no fault of our own. Syria, the point of conflict, remains a contested area between the Egyptians and Turks that pitifully vie for power on a national level. We are beyond such quarrels, therefore we shall end it once and for all and put the Egyptians in their place as our rightfully subdued servants. Then, and only then, can we forget this whole nonsensical ordeal ever occurred and rid ourselves of the pain of this shameful burden. The time is nigh to strike whilst they feud with their rivals, the Ottomans. Though of Mongolian descent similarly to us, we cannot hope to find an ally in their solidarity, as long ago they forsook this identity in favor of becoming distinctly Turkic. However, we will off them later, as we have more pressing matters."
 ilkhanate_conclusion_of_ain_jalut_title: "Conclusion of Ain Jalut"
 ilkhanate_conclusion_of_ain_jalut_desc: "Hundreds of years ago, we were greatly dishonored by the pitiful [MAM.GetName]. They had the audacity to halt Mongol expansion, the only loss we have not paid back in kind. Our recent conquests into Syria may have sated our appetite temporarily, but we must continue to prove our everlasting superiority."
 ilkhanate_the_mediterranean_khan_title: "Mediterranean Khan"
 ilkhanate_the_mediterranean_khan_desc: "Though Genghis dreamed of uniting the world, he was never able to achieve his goals. Fortunately, we might be able to take another step towards his wishes by constructing a grand fleet able to disperse our troops throughout the Mediterranean Sea and continue our conquests in the name of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 ilkhanate_colonial_ambitions_title: "Colonial Ambitions"
 ilkhanate_colonial_ambitions_desc: "Westward, our neighbors expand to the fabled 'New World.' We need no such nonsense, yet it would be a great opportunity to bring in much-needed wealth. Tales tell of a land 'down under', where horrid beasts reside. We should seek this place out and usurp its power."
 ilkhanate_fully_down_under_title: "Fully Down Under"
 ilkhanate_fully_down_under_desc: "We have located the legendary island, yet it does not seem as though our troops walk on the ceiling as previously described. Alas, it also appears to be inhabited, but we can still set up a permanent base there to harness the massive beasts that undoubtedly lurk."
 ilkhanate_australia_crisis_title: "Australia Crisis"
 ilkhanate_australia_crisis_desc: "We seem to have slightly overestimated the value of Australia. The problem is, we invested massive amounts of money into this venture, with little return. A recession is rising, and we may not be able to afford continued expansion into Asia and Europe. We need to make a last-minute effort to fix our Australian economic situation."
 ilkhanate_australian_empire_title: "Australian Empire"
 ilkhanate_australian_empire_desc: "Perhaps we gravely overestimated the value of Australia, but we might still find value in it. We should invest all we can into weaponizing the deadly wildlife here in order to scrape some semblance of gain from these ventures."
 ilkhanate_spider_trebuchets_title: "Spider Trebuchets"
 ilkhanate_spider_trebuchets_desc: "If we combine the classic yet effective siege weapon known as the trebuchet with our newfound knowledge of war spiders, we might be able to scrape out some value of Australia. Let's be honest, we're desperate."
 ilkhanate_ghost_of_genghis_khan_title: "Ghost of Genghis Khan"
 ilkhanate_ghost_of_genghis_khan_desc: "We have stood strong through the hardship and brought back the Khaganate from the brink of utter demise. No other Khanate has lasted as we so endured. Not only have we brought glory to our own empire, but we have proven the longevity of the Mongol Empire, and perhaps we might stand to restore its splendor in kind."
 ilkhanate_the_path_to_providence_title: "The Path to Providence"
 ilkhanate_the_path_to_providence_desc: "Our roots demand we tolerate those unfaithful to Allah, but our religious duty to our subjects demands we provide a stern stance on faith as a whole, spreading it and ensuring its propagation. We simply cannot use both the carrot and stick, we must choose between the two."
 ilkhanate_cross_the_caucuses_title: "Cross the Caucuses"
 ilkhanate_cross_the_caucuses_desc: "The Caucuses Mountains provide a natural border for hordes and empires alike. Although they stand tall, we shall not falter under their shiveringly intense gaze. The time has come to cross these grand mountains."
 ilkhanate_gunpowder_innovations_title: "Gunpowder Innovations"
 ilkhanate_gunpowder_innovations_desc: "Truly, our military research department is thriving. All it needed was the small push our allies gave to bring froth innovation. Years ago, gunpowder made its way west from China, bringing with it destruction. Fortunately, we are at the forefront of that technology's path, and have reason to exploit it. Though the obvious use is mining, perhaps we should invest in cannons as well."
 ilkhanate_crimean_expansion_title: "Crimean Expansion"
 ilkhanate_crimean_expansion_desc: "'For the power, the kingdom, and the glory are all yours.' The Crimeans and other descendants of the Golden Horde have forsaken their ancient Islamic pact with Allah, and they shall pay for it in their lives."
 ilkhanate_the_conquest_of_moscow_title: "The Conquest of Moscow"
 ilkhanate_the_conquest_of_moscow_desc: "The dreadful Moscovites betrayed the great solace the Golden Horde provided them. Usurping the Grand Mongol Throne, they banished their protectors and forged their new empire of evil. They shall be dealt with as if they were no better than filth, for only filth would act in such a needlessly evil manner."
 ilkhanate_restoration_of_the_golden_horde_title: "Restore the Golden Horde"
 ilkhanate_restoration_of_the_golden_horde_desc: "Our grand path of conquest has led to the point of climax: we may finally restore our long-lost older brother. Our rival. Our best friend. Let us make haste to both restore and surpass the Golden Horde."
 ilkhanate_the_great_islamic_awakening_title: "Great Islamic Awakening"
 ilkhanate_the_great_islamic_awakening_desc: "Now that our ambitions of a Grand [Root.GetName] have been realized, we can now look to the intellectual pursuits that constitute Islamic reign. There are several centers of learning we should take into consideration before doing so, but they shall become ours with the passage of time."
 ilkhanate_modernization_effort_title: "Modernization Effort"
 ilkhanate_modernization_effort_desc: "Europe lies as a bright beacon of technological innovation. While we hate to admit it, we must learn from them in order to bring our nation up to modern standards. The Holy Roman Empire stands at the forefront of modern technology, thus we would do well to learn from them."
 ilkhanate_military_cooperation_title: "Military Cooperation"
 ilkhanate_military_cooperation_desc: "Though we are mighty, our best military engineers perished centuries ago, alongside our grand empire. As our new empire does not exactly inspire great minds, we should borrow a few from our allies."
 ilkhanate_the_grand_horde_title: "The Grand Horde"
 ilkhanate_the_grand_horde_desc: "Our family of tribes has never seen better days, with each and every day bringing more land and more wealth. However, rival nomads continuously seek to provoke our wrath. Particularly the Tatar and Altaic nomads stir up quite a bit of trouble for us. If they wish for death, we shan't oppose."
 ilkhanate_mountainous_mayhem_title: "Mountainous Mayhem"
 ilkhanate_mountainous_mayhem_desc: "The Urals, though absolutely worthless in natural resources, are home to vast steppes that could host many horses and their riders. Expanding our cavalry corps has always been our top priority, and it shall stay that way."
 
 ILK_EVERY_OWNED_PROVINCE_GETS_ILKHANATE_MOUNTAIN_OF_OPPRESION_MODIFIER: "\nEvery owned province gets '§YFather of the Four Winds§!' for §Y20 years§!, giving the following effects: \nMonthly Devastation: §G-0.10§!"
 ILK_UNLOCKS_PIETY_DECISION: "Unlocks new decisions, which give you scaled bonuses for owned provinces that don't follow the §Y[Root.Religion.GetName]§! faith."

 # Events:
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTNAME1: "Choice of Command"
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTDESC1: "Now that the majority of India is under our control, we find ourselves extremely overextended in terms of centralized governance. We should establish a central command city in India to govern the region quasi-independently of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] while still remaining directly part of our empire."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events1.EVTOPT1: "The seat of the Bahmanis will serve us well."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events1.EVTOPT2: "Let us look to the Vijayanagar."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events1.EVTOPT3: "Let us choose a small but well-located town."
 
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTNAME2: "[TUR.GetAdjective] March"
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTDESC2: "With the completed conquest of Anatolia, and its consolidation under our Mongol Vassal, we may now look to fortifying and converting our outpost for both defensive and offensive purposes in regards to our European neighbors. The [TUR.GetName] shall know [Root.GetAdjective] might."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events2.EVTOPT1: "Begin the transformation and allow them to pay for it."
 
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTNAME3: "The Turkic Question"
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTDESC3: "With the swift resolution of our feud with the [MAM.GetName] at hand, we must look to the western Turks. Though a pitiful people, they represent a decent opportunity to expand into Europe. We should seek either subjugation or conquest."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events3.EVTOPT1: "They know nothing of warfare. We would gain little from cooperation."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events3.EVTOPT2: "They could, perhaps, be useful to us."
 
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTNAME4: "Fate of the West"
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTDESC4: "Despite our continued pushing, several empires will not yield to our might. Our naval prowess surpasses theirs, as does our army, but alas, we cannot seem to make much ground. We shall leave the tedious task of annexing the Franks to a command center, but the question is where."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events4.EVTOPT1: "A fine naval base will do."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events4.EVTOPT2: "Perhaps an old rival's capital."
 
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTNAME5: "Rebuilding of [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTDESC5: "Ever since [From.GetName] razed [Root.GetName], the city has been mainly focused on rebuilding itself. While it will always be a specter of its former glory, it has begun to approach livable conditions."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events5.EVTOPT1: "Interesting."
 
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTNAME6: "[alliance_target.GetAdjective]-[Root.GetAdjective] Alliance"
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTDESC6: "Despite countless tries in the past, our Mongol brethren were never able to successfully join forces with the Franks. Finally, that unfortunate turn of events has reversed, and we now stand united against our common enemies in the Islamic and Christian worlds alike. Our newfound alliance will shake the earth we walk upon as hosts of hooves and feet thunder across the steppes and deserts."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events6.EVTOPT1: "It's about time!"
 
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTNAME7: "The Horde Stands No Longer"
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTDESC7: "On this day, the last legitimate successor to the Golden Horde, the [GOL.GetName], fell to superior force and will. With their demise comes the extinction of the menace that spelt our doom, for while the Golden Horde's legacy of fear and anguish lives on, its grandeur is now dead."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events7.EVTOPT1: "They were doomed to fall."
 
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTNAME8: "Victory Against the [MAM.GetName]"
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events.EVTDESC8: "Our past shortcomings in warfare regarding the [MAM.GetAdjective] [MAM.GetName] seem to have faded alongside our empire, unwilling to return. This spells out resounding victories in our near future, for we shall defeat the enemy that all but inflicted our demise."
 ME_Ilkhanate_Events8.EVTOPT1: "They should have known their days were numbered."

 # Decisions:
 ilkhanate_call_upon_the_unfaithful_title: "Call Upon the Unfaithful"
 ilkhanate_call_upon_the_unfaithful_desc: "Our nation hosts a wide variety of heretics, heathens, and other blasphemous cultists the world would be better of without. Indeed, we should call forth these inglorious bastards and use them as the brunt of our army, for they hold no value in our eyes."
 ilkhanate_bequeath_religious_rights_title: "Bequeath Religious Rights"
 ilkhanate_bequeath_religious_rights_desc: "The vast communities of sacrilegious peasants that inhabit our grand nation, are perhaps the closest ties we have to local populations we bring under reign. By giving these minorities more rights, we may yet strengthen our ties to the people and centralize control."
 ilkhanate_reign_in_minorities_title: "Reign in Minorities"
 ilkhanate_reign_in_minorities_desc: "Whenever a problem arises, its origin can typically be traced to one of the many religious minorities that inhabit the Ilkhanate. Should they grow out of hand, they may stir dissent or even rebel, thus we must ensure their servitude by any means necessary."
 ilkhanate_call_jihad_title: "Call Jihad"
 ilkhanate_call_jihad_desc: "While we toil in turmoil over the state of our Greater Jihad, the Lesser Jihad remains unfulfilled. Islam's sword remains decrepit and aggressive, thus we must bring forth our own scimitar and strike at the enemies of Islam everywhere."
 
 ILK_DECISION_WAS_NOT_USED_WITHIN_LAST_20_YEARS: "Was NOT enacted within the last §Y20 years§!"
 ILK_DECISION_WAS_NOT_USED_WITHIN_LAST_40_YEARS: "Was NOT enacted within the last §Y40 years§!"
