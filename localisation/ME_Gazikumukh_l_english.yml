 # Missions:
 GAZ_betrayal_title: "Final Betrayal"
 GAZ_betrayal_desc: "When the Golden Horde collapsed, it was decided we were not vital. We now sit in the sights of its disgruntled children, in the path of conquest. We cannot allow this premature horde, feigning wisdom yet exhibiting youth, to defeat us. We must seek those who also face our plight to ensure mutual defense."
 GAZ_giant_title: "Giant Falling"
 GAZ_giant_desc: "The Giant of the North staggers. Pressure from Russia and Lithuania alike push upon the wall of steeds. They shan't expect an attack from our supposedly weak military."
 GAZ_heir_title: "Heir to Dagestan"
 GAZ_heir_desc: "The Sultanate remains a minor power of the scattered peoples of Dagestan. Indeed, we are naught but weak. Despite our abhorrent position, with our old allies all but gone, we can rise once more as the Gazikumukh Shamkhalate, Heir to Dagestan."
 GAZ_worth_title: "Homely Worth"
 GAZ_worth_desc: "Fearless we soar; speeding arrows ricochet. We have proven our worth as protector of the Avar people. The centerpiece of our soon-to-be empire lays in the dreadful hands of the Azerbaijanis, denying us our rights out of spite while overextending them. This insult cannot stand. Our demands for the city have been met with naught but laugher, thus one course of action remains."
 GAZ_whole_title: "Dagestan is Whole"
 GAZ_whole_desc: "Our ambitions are realized. Dagestan is one nation, as it should be. We, the Gazukumukhs, have shown the world that has beaten us down that, despite with weighted shoulders, we can stand taller than a mountain."
 GAZ_benign_title: "Benign Protector"
 GAZ_benign_desc: "The Avars, our subordinates, came to us for protection. Such is only natural, for we are the greatest of the Dagestani. Despite our differences, they have recognized our obvious superiority as the Heir to Dagestan, and thus we must honor our agreement to defend them. In the meantime, we should ensure the Avar peoples are treated well."
 GAZ_unity_title: "Dagestani Unity"
 GAZ_unity_desc: "The land of Dagestan cannot be splintered among the many tribes inhabitating it. Though we have taken steps towards regional unity, we must ensure we are not just a nation, but a people to stand against our foes."
