 form_paderborn_nation_title: "Form the Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn"
 form_paderborn_nation_desc: "The Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn was an ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1281 to 1802. The Diocese of Paderborn was founded in 799 by Pope Leo III. In the early years it was subordinated to the bishop of Würzburg. Since 855 the clergy had the right to elect the bishop. The diocese included the larger part of Lippe, Waldeck, and nearly half of the County of Ravensberg. \n\nWe, as the owner of §Y[2972.GetName]§!, have to honor this legacy and recreate the @PAD §YPrince-Bishopric of Paderborn§!."
