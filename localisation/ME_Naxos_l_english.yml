 NAX_initial_fortifications_title: "Initial Fortifications"
 NAX_initial_fortifications_desc: "The Ottomans march to a common beat, signaling our ever-approaching demise. The Janissaries are a disciplined force to be reckoned, but we cannot falter under their seemingly unstoppable force. We shall be the stiff shield that halts the piercing spear."
 NAX_troubling_tides_title: "Troubling Tides"
 NAX_troubling_tides_desc: "In the wake of the Fourth Crusade, several crusader states, including our very own Duchy of the Archipelago, were formed. That wake now subsides, leaving an empowered Muslim menace and a plethora of hostile neighbors, that, if chance allows it, will end our existence in a swift, brutish, and terrible manner. We cannot allow this fate to emerge from the depths of the Aegean, lest all that we have built sink unto it. It is clear now that Venice cannot defend our sovereignty, thus we must ensure our own safety through a hardy militia and barreling fleet."
 NAX_fallback_islands_title: "Fallback Islands"
 NAX_fallback_islands_desc: "The oncoming storm cannot weather what it cannot reach. If we spread our defenses among our various islands, the Turks must siege each individual island, thus creating a chain of garrisons and significantly prolonging our defense."
 NAX_duchy_no_more_title: "Duchy No More"
 NAX_duchy_no_more_desc: "We are the profound Duchy of the Archipelago, yet our God-given fate allows for so much more. Our duchy need not be a mere duchy, but a grand kingdom in which our legions of soldiers proclaim legitimacy for. We need but prove to the world that we are worthy of such a title."
 NAX_army_of_our_own_title: "Army of our Own"
 NAX_army_of_our_own_desc: "Upon these island peaks we laid and waited for our demise. No more shall we dawdle complacently, for we are the masters of our own fate. Upon these island peaks we lay, strong and hardy, bringing forth our own masterful victory upon which our ascension to greatness shall rise."
 NAX_unfathomable_depths_title: "Unfathomable Depths"
 NAX_unfathomable_depths_desc: "Beneath the sodden sands and soils that provides that foundation for our great nation, lies the expanse of the Aegean Sea, perhaps the depths of which are known to mankind. Unfortunately, the same knowledge applies little to our situation. We are fathoms deep into a Turkic menace the likes of which we have never seen. If the Seljuks were rabid curs, the Ottomans seem to be wild beasts, savages of the Old World. We require security the likes of which Venice obviously cannot provide. We should seek support elsewhere."
 NAX_strike_out_title: "Strike Out"
 NAX_strike_out_desc: "No more shall we live in fear of the Turks. With the help of our allies, we have become mighty and full of vigor and vitality. Confidence grows by the day of our resiliance, for this is but another crusade, the likes of which were the very origins of our grand duchy."
 NAX_impending_doom_title: "Impeding Doom"
 NAX_impending_doom_desc: "Our army, though grand and prestigious, may as well not exist when faced with the impending Ottoman menace. We cannot rely on our own blood when faced with such an overwhelming force. We must solve this issue diplomatically, if at all."
 NAX_island_garrisons_title: "Island Garrisons"
 NAX_island_garrisons_desc: "The oncoming storm has not hampered its speed nor growth. We are but a mere archipelago, therefore our best defense lies in our numerous small islands. Though we already have fallback islands, perhaps providing each individual island with its own fort and garrison, independent of the rest, would hinder any invaders."
 NAX_heir_to_byzantium_title: "Heir to Byzantium"
 NAX_heir_to_byzantium_desc: "The Ottomans beckon; we cannot delay. Their grip on Byzantium slips by the day as their state expands and contracts with the coming years. Undoubtedly, an opportunity will arise that will allow us to take back the metropolis. Until then, we must bid our time."
 NAX_lordship_of_negroponte_title: "Lordship of Negroponte"
 NAX_lordship_of_negroponte_desc: "Our longtime influencers, the Venetians, will perhaps miss us, but we shan't let them forget us. The Triarchy of Negroponte, our dutiful neighbor and fellow crusader state, is perhaps even more influenced by Venice than us. We cannot let the honorable Aegean Archipelago fall to such foreign influence. We must liberate our brethren!"
 NAX_wandering_hospitaller_title: "Wandering Hospitaller"
 NAX_wandering_hospitaller_desc: "Long have the Knights of St. John marched, from Jerusalem, to Tripoli, then to Cyprus, finally to end up at Rhodes. These knights, bound by chivalry, are among the last of the crusader states. We must band together if we are to challenge the target of the New Crusade: The Ottoman Empire."
 NAX_lordship_of_chios_title: "Lordship of Chios"
 NAX_lordship_of_chios_desc: "Among the decentralized archipelagos of the Aegean, Chios is perhaps in the most dangerous position, with limited resources save wine, and limited protection in the face of Turkic naval supremacy. We cannot allow our brethren to fall victim to the Ottoman menace, therefore we must bring them under our all-encompassing embrace."
 NAX_grand_aegean_fishery_title: "Grand Aegean Fishery"
 NAX_grand_aegean_fishery_desc: "For too long, nations further west have dominated the fishing industry. We are a nation of grand wineries and fisheries; why should we remain in the shadows? We should ensure our fish are exported thoroughly for our profit."
 NAX_kingdom_of_candia_title: "Kingdom of Candia"
 NAX_kingdom_of_candia_desc: "The nearby Kingdom of Candia, under lordship of Venice, poses both a threat and an opportunity. They exist in the perfect position to launch a naval assault on our many islands, but they lie relatively exposed to our grand armada. We should bring them into our growing archipelago to ensure their safety as well as ours."
 NAX_vineyards_of_the_aegean_title: "Vineyards of the Aegean"
 NAX_vineyards_of_the_aegean_desc: "We are among the few places in the known world that can produce wine in such a lucurative fashion. We should expand the vineyards in our recently conquered islands to expedite the export of this glorious beverage."
 NAX_reclaim_tripoli_title: "Reclaim Tripoli"
 NAX_reclaim_tripoli_desc: "The old county of Tripoli, located near Jerusalem, shall be our next point of conquest. We shall fulfill our obligations to the Papacy and the Lord and ensure Muslim rule leaves these blessed lands once and for all."
 NAX_order_of_cyprus_title: "Order of Cyprus"
 NAX_order_of_cyprus_desc: "Indeed, among the last of the crusader states remains Cyprus, constantly locked between Ottoman and Egyptian influence to the point of near-dependence. We cannot afford to allow the island to fall completely under Muslim rule."
