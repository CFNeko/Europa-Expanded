 byzantium_library_of_alexandria_desc: "Dedicated to the Muses, goddesses of Arts and Culture, the Library of Alexandria was a universal hub of accumulated knowledge (an estimated total of 400,000 scrolls) established in the port city of [358.GetName]. Sadly, after a steady decline over time, an accidental fire set under the orders of Julius Ceasar during his civil war spelled the tragic destruction of the library. It is up to us, as the legitimate successors of Rome, to re-establish it for the world to see."
 byzantium_reignite_the_imperial_army_title: "Reignite the Imperial Army"
 byzantium_reignite_the_imperial_army_desc: "[Root.GetName], no longer the Empire it used to be, has fallen in a state of spiraling decay.

 byzantium_across_the_coast_title: "Across the Coast"
 byzantium_across_the_coast_desc: "For centuries the coast across our beautiful capital was ruled by our Regents, enriching the local trade business and contributing a large sum of income to our coffers.

 byzantium_sweet_home_anatolia_title: "Sweet Home Anatolia"

 byzantium_recover_the_holy_cities_desc: "Cities long lost in the hands of the infidels, often the apple of discord between the \"Pope\" and the Arabs, shall now be ours! [2313.GetName] and [379.GetName] used to be under [Root.GetAdjective] rule and they shall be once again."
 byzantium_border_in_the_levant_title: "Border in the Levant"

 byzantium_city_of_sinope_desc: "What used to be a hub of [Root.GetAdjective] trade, a pathway from the depths of Crimea and Persia into the Bosporus, is now under Muslim hands.

 byzantium_the_marble_emperor_desc: "At our darkest time, just as our last bastion of faith, our capital, was about to fall, an angel of the Lord raised our Emperor to the heavens.

God was never on their side."
 byzantium_reinstate_the_patriarchates_title: "Reinstate the Patriarchates"
 byzantium_reinstate_the_patriarchates_desc: "After the complete victory of our armed foces over the scourge of Anatolia, our next natural goal is to reconstruct the Holy Cities of [2313.GetName], [379.GetName] and [358.GetName] and provide the local faithful with a much needed breath of religious fervor and freedom from the opression of their former Muslim overlords."

 byzantium_mend_the_schism_desc: "Several disputes over the proper application of devotion and faith in matters such as Communion, the divinity of Mary, and the procession of the Holy Spirit led to the split of the world's grandest religious. From its ashes rose 2 sibling religions: Orthodoxy and Catholicism. By taking the capital of Catholicism, [118.GetName], we shall send a rippling message throughout Europe and denounce their faith as heretical, effectively forcing the remnants of their followers to either convert by the sword or the priest."
 byzantium_expand_the_thedosian_walls_title: "Theodosian Walls"
 byzantium_expand_the_thedosian_walls_desc: "Upon the death of Emperor Arcadius, Theodosius erected the famed Theodosian Walls. This monumental task took several years to complete and it proved to be one of the most formidable defensive stractures in Euorope. Recent advances in gunpowder deem it necessary we upgrade these legendary fortifications and renew their grandeur."
 byzantium_light_of_the_east_title: "Light of the East"
 byzantium_light_of_the_east_desc: "Since the beginning of our great Empire and the split between East and West, our capital has been the vibrant light shining throughout our vast Empire.

 byzantium_deeper_in_italy_title: "Deeper in Italy"
 byzantium_deeper_in_italy_desc: "The atrocities and dealths in Apulia and Calabria were but the prologue of what's about to befall on these Catholic Heretics. It's time we carve deeper into Italy and force them to bend the knee."
 byzantium_birthplace_of_renaissance_title: "Birthplace of Renaissance"
 byzantium_birthplace_of_renaissance_desc: "Since the mid 15th century, when the Renaissance was born in Italy, we have longed to make its birthplace part of our realm, effectively usurping the prestigious title of most enlightened Empire in Europe. The Renaissance of the fifteenth century was, in many things, great rather by what it designed then by what it achieved."
 byzantium_rebuild_the_colossus_title: "Rebuild the Colossus"
 byzantium_rebuild_the_colossus_desc: "Millenia ago, in the island of [320.GetName] there stood a magnificent figure of a giant Colossus, made of iron and bronze, a breathatknig sight to behold and a pillar of the trade community of [320.GetName].

 byzantium_annhilation_of_italy_desc: "Vast stretches of Italian lands now lay in ruins, conquered by our mighty armies. As we lay siege on the last bastion of the Italians, a new era rises from the hills of Syracuse to the mountains of Piedmont. An era of [Root.GetAdjective] Rule!"
 byzantium_a_land_far_away_title: "A Land Far Away"
 byzantium_a_land_far_away_desc: "Tales of deserts in the West, just under the bright blue shores of the Mediterranean reach our ears as we spread our influence in Egypt. The region used to be a well established Roman territory, conquered from the barbarian Carthaginians. As we lay claim on our old borders, we look beyond our borders, in an attempt to grow even stronger. [TUN.GetName] shall bend the knee."
 byzantium_believers_in_maghreb_title: "Believers in Maghreb"
 byzantium_believers_in_maghreb_desc: "In order to ensure that the region of Maghreb will not slip out of our grasp again, we need to put effort into turning the local Muslim population into our own brethren in Faith. This will allow them to feel more akin to us, and less towards potential unruly revolutionary elements."
 byzantium_pax_hispaniola_title: "Pax Hispaniola"
 byzantium_pax_hispaniola_desc: "Drive the Andalusians straight to the sea, give these wretched dogs some water. It is time for Iberia to bend the knee, to the mighty @BYZ §YByzantine Empire§!. Let us reinstate the old lands of the Empire as our ancestors saw fit to prescribe on us."
 byzantium_carve_morocco_title: "Carve Morocco"
 byzantium_carve_morocco_desc: "As we push deeper in the Maghreb, we come across a beautiful series of urban complexes, the Moroccan Imperial Cities, beautifully standing tall along the eastern part of the region, once crossed by Hercules himself on his journey beyond our waters.

 byzantium_ghost_of_an_empire_title: "Ghost of an Empire"
 byzantium_ghost_of_an_empire_desc: "Age old clashes and bloodshed has ceased since the Bulgarian Empire was subjugated time and time again. The land and its people have seen many masters come and go over the last few centuries. It is time the Bulgarian land return to [Root.GetAdjective] hands."

 byzantium_archipelago_ex_machina_desc: "Over the beautiful shores of the Aegean Sea lie pockets of Greek citizens in [164.GetName], [2348.GetName] and [320.GetName].

 byzantium_into_the_balkans_title: "Into the Balkans"
 byzantium_into_the_balkans_desc: "As we push deeper into the Balkans, it becomes evident that nothing can stop the immesurable power of our troops. Led by fine nobles we dig deeper on our way to Macedonia and Kosovo. It is time our enemies taste bitter defeat!"

 byzantium_tame_the_black_army_desc: "To our North lies a fearsome foe, [HUN.GetName]. The Hunyadis and the von Habsburgs have long forgotten what true power really looks like, squabbling over petty Unholy Empires. It is time we teach these dogs what true terror is. Their land shall be ours by the sword and the will of God."

 ME_Byzantium_Events.EVTDESC1: "The day the stars fell down on us and the sun refused to shine, as our shackles are undone and the old words cease to rhyme, the bastion of Catholicism fell, sending a resounding message of defeat throughout the entire continent. For there is no heaven in the sky but our own, reigning supreme. Hell never awaited for our downfall, as we clawed our way back from the brink of extinction. Let today be marked as the day that the voice of reason shined, let the heretics vanish for all times, God's face is hidden no more, we are victorious!"

 ME_Byzantium_Events.EVTNAME2: "Forceful Amends"
 ME_Byzantium_Events.EVTDESC2: "The message has finally began to spread. [118.GetName] has fallen to the Orthdox! The body of the late Pope has been desecrated and fed to the dogs, buried in an unmarked grave as the soldiers pillaged and raped what was left unburnt in the city. Days went by as the atrocities began to fade and the messenger from the [From.GetAdjective] court arrived, demanding our conversion. How should we respond?"

 ME_Byzantium_Events.EVTDESC6: "Despite our relations not always being the best, the [From.GetAdjective]s have proven time and time again that they are the shield of Christendom against the Turks of Anatolia. Now they come to us, asking for our submission, a very delicate matter indeed. What shall we do ? Side with them  and let go of our freedom, or defy them?"
