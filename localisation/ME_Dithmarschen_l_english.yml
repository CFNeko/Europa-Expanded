 dtt_earthworks_title: "Earthworks"
 dtt_earthworks_desc: "Earthworks in a land filled with marshes are great defensive endeavours. Any invading army will need to reckon itself with such fortifications, unless they want to be crushed under the mighty boot! Watch out Black Guard, here come the peasants!"
 dtt_resist_and_bite_title: "Resist and Bite"
 dtt_resist_and_bite_desc: "We shall not only resist the Danish, but also bite them. Bite them hard. The Danish King tried to claim his rule over our peaceful republic and now he shall suffer.

 dtt_claim_independence_title: "Claim Independence"
 dtt_claim_independence_desc: "The Men in Verden and Bremen have been pulling the strings in our country for far too long. They have made many decisions about our country without or consent. It's time that they pay for their crimes against us! The Sacred Republic only answers to God and Emperor!"
